\section{Introduction}

Staking is a mechanism used in proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain
systems~\cite{2018tendermint, buchman2016tendermint,
ouroboros, algorand, casper} to ensure the security and
integrity of the network.
Users can stake their coins, in order to
participate in the consensus validation process and earn
rewards in return.
Delegation is a process that allows
stakeholders to delegate the responsibility of staking to
other users called validators.

One of the main disadvantages of staking is that
users cannot use their staked assets for transactions
and other DeFi applications~\cite{defi-sok}, making them miss
out on potential rewards and opportunities.
Liquid staking tries to solve this problem by issuing
a fungible token for users to utilize for other purposes,
while still getting staking rewards.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Staking, Delegation
    \item Liquid Staking
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Staking APY + DeFi APY
            \item Liquid Stake VS Underlying price difference 
            \item Fungibility
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Our contributions.} Our contributions in this paper are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We describe and systematize the desirable properties of Liquid Staking systems.
    \item We showcase the Principal--Agent problem in the Liquid Staking setting and describe a concrete attack leveraging it.
    \item We give a precise formula of Exempt Delegations which resolves the Principal--Agent problem.
\end{enumerate}
