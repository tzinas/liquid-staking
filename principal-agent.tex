\section{The Principal--Agent Problem}
In the Proof-of-Stake systems described in the previous sections,
delegators grant permission of their funds to validators so they can
participate in consensus on their behalf.
Hence, delegators have ownership of the stake, but
validators have control over it.
The stakeholders rely on validators to act according to their
best interest: Stay online and follow the protocol.
However, validators (the Agent) may have extrinsic motivation to
misbehave and plot against delegators (the Principal). This creates
a conflict of interest that is known as the Principal--Agent problem.




\begin{itemize}
    \item Principal--Agent Problem (example from company)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item More nuanced model than honest/adversarial: stakeholders are not honest or adversarial, but can make ``right'' or ``wrong'' choice; validators are honest and adversarial.
            \item Fairness: You should not be slashed if you make the ``right'' choice.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Wise and unwise model
\end{itemize}
