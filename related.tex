Proof-of-Stake was introduced by PeerCoin~\cite{peercoin} and formalized
in later works~\cite{ouroboros,praos,ouroboros-genesis,algorand,DBLP:journals/iacr/BentovPS16a}.
Slashing~\cite{slashing} is a technique used to achieve economic safety~\cite{slashable-safety}
in many PoS systems, among others
PoS Ethereum~\cite{casper,buterin2020combining}
and Cosmos~\cite{2018tendermint,buchman2016tendermint,cosmossdk}.
Outside of centralized exchanges, liquid staking was introduced by Felix Lutsch
as \emph{Delegation Vouchers}~\cite{delegation-vouchers}
and later analyzed in a comprehensive report~\cite{liquid-staking-report} with
the help of the Liquid Staking Working Group.
Lido~\cite{lido} and Rocket Pool~\cite{rocket-pool} popularized liquid staking
in Ethereum, and Quicksilver~\cite{quicksilver}, Stride~\cite{stride} and
pStake~\cite{pstake} in Cosmos. Quicksilver is the first protocol to propose proportional
representation, but this is not yet implemented.
Besides liquid staking, stake rehypothecation takes the form of
restaking (EigenLayer~\cite{eigenlayer}) and cross staking~\cite{mesh-security}.
%DeFi~\cite{defi-sok} governance models were studied in \emph{Blockchains Without Romance}~\cite{web3-governance}.
