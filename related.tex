Proof-of-stake (PoS), introduced by PeerCoin~\cite{peercoin}, was formalized
in later works~\cite{ouroboros,praos,ouroboros-genesis,algorand,DBLP:journals/iacr/BentovPS16a}.
Slashing~\cite{slashing} is a technique used to achieve economic safety~\cite{slashable-safety}
in many PoS systems, among others
PoS Ethereum~\cite{casper,buterin2020combining}
and Cosmos~\cite{2018tendermint,buchman2016tendermint,cosmossdk}.
Outside of centralized exchanges, liquid staking was introduced independently by
the team of Joe Bowman, Brian Crain, Felix Lutsch, Dev Ojha, Meher Roy (from Chorus One and Sikka),
and Hyung Yeon Lee (from B-Harvest) in June 2019.
First reported as \emph{Delegation Vouchers}~\cite{delegation-vouchers}
they were later analyzed in a comprehensive report~\cite{liquid-staking-report} with
the help of the Liquid Staking Working Group.
Lido~\cite{lido} and Rocket Pool~\cite{rocket-pool} popularized liquid staking
in Ethereum, and Quicksilver~\cite{quicksilver}, Stride~\cite{stride} and
pStake~\cite{pstake} in Cosmos. Quicksilver is the first protocol to propose proportional
representation, but this is not yet implemented.
Besides liquid staking, stake rehypothecation takes the form of
restaking (EigenLayer~\cite{eigenlayer}) and cross staking~\cite{mesh-security}.
Exempt delegations, with one name or another, are used in Rocket Pool,
and have been proposed for Cosmos~\cite{adr-liquid-staking}.
%DeFi~\cite{defi-sok} governance models were studied in \emph{Blockchains Without Romance}~\cite{web3-governance}.
